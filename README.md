# Stochastic-Circuit
This repo accompanies the paper "Principles of Low Dissipation Computing from a Stochastic Circuit Model" by Chloe Ya Gao and David T. Limmer.

1. NOT_deterministic.py: a python code that solves the master equation for the NOT gate
2. NOT_Gillespie.cpp: a c++ code that performs Gillespie algorithm for the NOT gate
3. capacity_Gaussian.py: a python code that computes the capacity of the NOT gate under Gaussian distribution of the output voltage
